# ColorMemorySwitch
A colorful game

A memory game where players have to match pairs of tiles based on their colors. The twist is that the colors change their shades slightly over time, making it more challenging to find the pairs. Some buttons will be diagonally seperated with two similar tones.

Features:
Dynamic Color - A variety of tones for each level with a theme. 

Multiple Levels - The gird will increase in size as the levels progress. 

Time Challenge - A timer to display the time limit. The time changes as the levels progress.

Score System - Users can gain rewards for finishing before the time limit. Points for the number of matches found and the time taken. Streak bonuses and accuracy will also be rewarded. There will be a deduction in points when a hint is used. End of level sumary view is not included in the wireframes but will in added later.

Hints -  A limited number of times a matching pair will be revealed for a short amount of time

High Scores - A leadership board that shows the highest scores and the fastest times


Notes on specs on items not included:
The grid does not have a variety in colors yet. The background colors, animations, and font colors are still being worked on.
